# Budget Manager - C++ Project
The project is designed to help manage personal budgets. The program reads an input file and creates a hierarchical structure of categories in the form of a tree. Each category is associated with items that consist of a description, occurrence date, and amount. The program allows for various budget management functions, such as adding, editing, and deleting categories and items.
